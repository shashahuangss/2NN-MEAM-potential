# MEAM-potential

This potential is designed for simulations focused on understanding and predicting the behavior of irradiation resistance of Ni-Al-Co-Ti system, emphasizing their structural order. 
The parameters have been refined to accurately reflect the site preference of Ni, Co, Al, and Ti elements in the L12 A3B intermetallic structure. 
The potential effectively reproduces key physical properties such as lattice constants, defect formation energies, and defect kinetics, demonstrating reasonable agreement with experimental data and first-principles calculations. 
Furthermore, this potential was used to systematically explore the irradiation resistance and kinetic reordering capabilities of the multicomponent intermetallic systems, showing good consistency with experimental observations.
